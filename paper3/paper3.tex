\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item South West Seismic Zone (SWSZ) - one of Australia's most active source zones
\item Poor station coverage makes accurate location difficult
\item Kalannie earthquake cluster (figure \ref{fig:-Kalannie-map}(a))
\item \citet{dr_Dawson08a} composite mechanism (ref table \ref{tab-Dawson-Kalannie-results})
\item Validity of composite mechanism assumes overlapping rupture on the same fault - we demonstrate that
assumption holds despite the poor station coverage
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute Kalannie event sizes (Table \ref{tab:Kalannie-eventsizes}) and comment on location
accuracy required to demonstrate that events are overlapping
\item Relative location with a few stations - use the coda
\item CWI separation (\citealp{dr_Snieder05a}; \citealp{dr_Snieder06a})
\item Possible to get separation estimate with a single station (e.g. \citealp{dr_Robinson07b})
\item \textbf{ref Paper1} - formulates CWI probabilistically for a pair of events - must comment on wavelength normalisation
\item \textbf{ref Paper2} - formulation of the joint posterior, misfit function $L$ and minimization by optimisation.
\item Problem with optimisation approach is that it gives a single solution only and can get trapped in
local minima. We use Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) here which allows a complete assessment of uncertainty.
This is only possible because of the small number of events considered.
\item \textbf{Malcolm and Roel - there is potentially a large number of equations to show here. I propose that we keep
the number of equations as small as possible and refer readers to the other papers and the thesis for details. Any
thoughts?}
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss waveforms, first arrival similarity and filtering between 1 and 2\,Hz (Figure \ref{fig:-Kalannie-map}(b))
\item We only have access to data from 3 stations MORW, BLDU and KLBR (Figure \ref{fig:-Kalannie-map}(a))
\item Application of CWI on event pairs (Figure \ref{fig:-Kalannie-map}(b))
\item Computation of CWI based pairwise separation posteriors (Figure \ref{fig:Kalannie-CWI-Posteriors})
\item Compare MCMC results (Expected Value and standard error) to optimisation solution (Table \ref{tab:Kalannie-InversionRes})
\item MCMC in more detail: 1D marginals, covariance and correlation (Figure \ref{fig:Kalannie-CWI-NAB-1Dmarginals})
\item MCMC in more detail: example 2D marginal (Figure \ref{fig:Kalannie-2Dmarginals_param23}).
Shows that events 1 and 2 are close but not co-located.
\item Discuss the separation estimates which incorporate CWI from all pairs (e.g. Table \ref{tab:-KalannieRes-separations})
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The power of CWI when limited stations available
\item Advantage of the MCMC inversion approach (i.e. detailed picture of uncertainty). Disadvantage that it
is computationally expensive (ref \textbf{Paper2} for optimisation approach with more events).
\item Demonstration that the events are close but not co-located. Consistent with hypothesis that the
four ruptures overlap on the same fault.
\end{itemize}

the \cite{dr_Dawson08a} composite focal mechanism for the Kalannie events,
large historical events (focal mechanisms), observed seismicity between 1998 to 2007 (circles) and
Quaternary fault scarps (black lines) identified by \citet{dr_Clark09a}. The three available recording stations
MORW (162\,km), BLDU (67\,km) and KLBR (169\,km) are depicted with red triangles. Figure courtesy of
\citet{dr_Dawson08a} with minor modifications. (b) Example waveforms and CWI separation estimates
for the Kalannie events. The top row illustrates waveforms at station MORW for Event 1 normalised to maximum
amplitude and filtered between 1 and 2\,Hz for the three channels N,Z,E. Relative P, S and surface wave arrivals are also
indicated at 0, 19 and 27\,s, respectively. Middle row demonstrates similarity of first arrivals at station MORW for Events 1 and 2 in
the three channels. The bottom row shows the CWI separation estimates at MORW
as a function of sliding time window with width 5\,s for event pair 1 and 2. The three traces
represent different channels and the vertical black lines
enclose the region between $t=$5\,s and $t_{surf}$ that we consider for the remaining analysis.}

Labels $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$ and $\hat{z}$ refer to a local coordinate system with
origin corresponding to the event 1 location. Subscripts indicate the event number. Missing
parameters $\hat{y}_2$, $\hat{z}_2$ and $\hat{z}_3$ are set to 0 to remove rotational non-uniqueness without
loss of generality. Grey shaded regions illustrate the probability of each coordinate
being within 500\,m of the origin. The relative size of the shaded area
indicates that all event coordinates are likely within 500\,m of event 1
(see table \ref{tab:Kalannie-InversionRes} for actual areas). (b) Covariance and (c) correlation matrices
for the Kalannie earthquake location coordinates.
Different colours in the covariance matrix suggest different levels of resolvability between
coordinates. The off-diagonal structure of the correlation matrix indicates
a low level of trade-off between different coordinates.}

 Capitalize the first letter of each word (expect for
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
 three or fewer letters).

 Do not hyphenate level 1 heads. To break lines,
 type \protect\\ where you want the break to occur.
 AGU prefers the inverted triangle, breaking before

 AGU prefers the inverted triangle, breaking before
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles, if possible.

\subsection{Level 2 Head} An example.

 ---------------
 Level 3 head

 Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads

 Capitalize only the first letter of the first word, acronyms,
 first letter of proper nouns, and first letter of first word
 after a colon.

 Hyphenation is permitted in level 3 heads, if needed.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.

 Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered e.g.:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered e.g.:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

% There is another multiline equation environment:
% \begin{aguleftmath}...\end{aguleftmath}
% The equation is aligned left and the second line indents to
% the width of a paragraph indent (AGU style)

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%
% To reset the equation counter, place the setcounter{equation}
% command in front of your equation(s).
%\setcounter{equation}{0}

% Set the equation counter to 0 if the next
% number needed is 1 or set it to 7 if the
% next number needed is 8, etc.
%
% The \setcounter{equation} command does affect
% equations appearing later in the manuscript.

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
